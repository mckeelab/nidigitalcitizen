# NI Digital Citizen
Brainstorming site for what NI Digital Citizenship could look like - THIS IS THINKING OUT LOUD, NOT POLICY!

## Introduction
Northern Ireland finds itself in a unique situation globally, due to vagaries of history and geography, good times and bad. It sits as one of a small number of places where an armed conflict has been transformed into a lasting, albeit imperfect, peace. Looking to the future, it has emerged from the chaos of Brexit to be a place of opportunity - where people can be Irish and British, where businesses can trade with the EU and UK. It's an adaptor zone between two of the world's most important economies. A place where UK, Ireland, EU and the world can meet to face the challenges of the 21st Century.
