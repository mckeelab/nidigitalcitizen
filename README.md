# NI Digital Citizen
Brainstorming site for what NI Digital Citizenship could look like - THIS IS THINKING OUT LOUD, NOT POLICY!

## Introduction
Northern Ireland finds itself in a unique situation globally, due to vagaries of history and geography, good times and bad. It sits as one of a small number of places where an armed conflict has been transformed into a lasting, albeit imperfect, peace. Looking to the future, it has emerged from the chaos of Brexit to be a place of opportunity - where people can be Irish and British, where businesses can trade with the EU and UK. It's an adaptor zone between two of the world's most important economies. A place where UK, Ireland, EU and the world can meet to face the challenges of the 21st Century.

## What is NI Digital Citizenship?
An individual or a company can apply for NI Digital Citizenship. On approval, the NI Digital Citizen can digitally register a company in NI and have preferential access to UK and EU markets subject to the provisions of the Westminster Framework. In addition, hundreds of business services are available from other NI companies, allowing you to participate in a burgeoning network of talent and opportunity that has a truly global reach. Other services and facilities in Northern Ireland may be available at highly preferential rates to NI Digital Citizens.

## Does NI Digital Citizenship confer residency status?
By becoming a NI Digital Citizen, you become one of us. You join this unique partnership and community, centred on NI, that extends to the rest of Ireland, the UK, the EU and beyond. NI Digital Citizens retain their existing residency rights and nationality, and do not qualify automatically for residency or voting eligibility in NI. Standard immigration and movement policies are set by governments and international treaties. However as a new member of our truly global Digital Diaspora, you're also bringing something of NI to the place where you live, and in our modern age, it's all about building those connections.

## What do I do now?
